# OpenPlate

A free, open-source calorie tracker for iPhone and Android, built with Expo (React Native).
German and English, light and dark mode, all data stays on the phone.

**Features**

- **Food diary** with breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks, calorie ring, macro bars and per-meal targets
- **Food search**: ~100 built-in basics (German and English names) plus millions of packaged products from [Open Food Facts](https://world.openfoodfacts.org)
- **Barcode scanner** (EAN-13/8, UPC) with Open Food Facts lookup; unknown products can be created on the spot
- **AI photo logging** with *your own* AI: Claude, OpenAI, Google Gemini (free tier), or a model running on your own PC via Ollama / LM Studio. Primary + fallback provider; the fallback is asked when the first fails or is unsure, and the more confident answer wins. Every item and portion can be corrected before saving.
- **Quick add**, **custom foods**, **recent foods**, **copy a meal from yesterday**
- **Personal plan** from a short onboarding (Mifflin-St Jeor + activity level + weekly pace), four macro presets
- **Intermittent fasting**: 12:12, 14:10, 16:8, 18:6, 20:4, 23:1 timers with phases, adjustable start time and a notification when you reach the goal; 5:2 and 6:1 with chosen fasting days that lower the calorie goal automatically
- **Water tracker** with tappable glasses
- **Weight log** with chart (30/90/365 days), BMI, progress towards the target
- **Steps** from the iPhone motion sensor, optionally added to the calorie budget (iPhone only; Android doesn't offer daily step history to apps without Health Connect)
- **Export** all data as JSON

## Install on your phone

Every push to `main` builds both apps on GitHub for free (Actions tab → *Build apps*, about 30 minutes) and publishes them under **[Releases](../../releases/latest)**.

### Android

1. On the phone, open the latest release and download **OpenPlate.apk**.
2. Open it and allow *Install unknown apps* for your browser when asked.
3. Updates: download the newer APK and install it over the old one. Your data stays.

### iPhone (free, with SideStore)

Apple only lets apps signed with a free Apple ID run for 7 days. **SideStore** renews the signature on the phone itself, so after a one-time setup with your PC you don't need to do anything.

**One-time setup on Windows**

1. Install **iTunes** from apple.com (the download from apple.com, not the Microsoft Store version) so Windows can talk to the iPhone.
2. Install **iloader** (the `.msi` from <https://github.com/nab138/iloader/releases>).
3. On the iPhone, install **LocalDevVPN** from the App Store, open it and tap *Connect*.
4. Plug the iPhone into the PC, tap *Trust*. In iloader, sign in with your normal Apple ID and click **SideStore (Stable)**.
5. On the iPhone: *Settings → General → VPN & Device Management* → trust your Apple ID. Then *Settings → Privacy & Security → Developer Mode* → on (the phone restarts).
6. Open SideStore and sign in with the same Apple ID.

**Add OpenPlate**

1. In SideStore → *Sources* → **+**, add:
   `https://github.com/louislam69/openplate/releases/latest/download/source.json`
2. Tap **Get** next to OpenPlate.
3. New versions show up in SideStore with an **Update** button. Your data stays.

Keep LocalDevVPN installed; SideStore uses it to renew apps in the background. If OpenPlate ever stops opening, open SideStore and tap *Refresh All*.
Limits set by Apple for free Apple IDs: 3 sideloaded apps at once (SideStore counts as one) and 10 installs per week.

## Develop on your PC (optional)

Live-reload while changing the code, using the Expo Go app:

```powershell
npm install
npx expo install --fix
npx expo start
```

Scan the QR code with the phone camera. The project uses Expo **SDK 54**; Expo Go on the phone must support the same SDK (shown in Expo Go → Settings).

## Set up the AI photo feature

In the app: **Profile → AI settings**. Choose a primary and (optionally) a fallback AI.

| Provider | Cost | What you need |
|---|---|---|
| Google Gemini | free tier | Key from <https://aistudio.google.com/apikey>. On the free tier Google may use requests to improve its products. |
| Ollama (your PC) | free | See below |
| LM Studio (your PC) | free | Load a vision model, Developer tab → start server, enable *Serve on Local Network*. Address `http://<PC-IP>:1234/v1` |
| Claude | pay per use | Key from <https://console.anthropic.com> |
| OpenAI | pay per use | Key from <https://platform.openai.com/api-keys> |

Model names are editable in the app; defaults are `gemini-3.8-flash`, `claude-sonnet-5-5`, `gpt-6-luna`, `qwen2.5vl:7b`. Providers rename models from time to time, so if a test fails with "model not found", check the provider's model list.

**Ollama on Windows (free, private)**

1. Install from <https://ollama.com/download>.
2. Download a vision model: `ollama pull qwen2.5vl:7b` (about 6 GB; smaller alternative: `gemma3:4b`).
3. Let the iPhone reach it: Windows Settings → *Edit environment variables for your account* → new variable `OLLAMA_HOST` = `0.0.0.0` → quit Ollama from the tray and start it again. Allow it through the firewall on private networks.
4. Find your PC's address with `ipconfig` (IPv4 address, e.g. `192.168.178.20`).
5. In the app, set *Server address* to `http://192.168.178.20:11434/v1` and tap **Test connection**.

A local 7B model on a normal PC takes roughly 10–60 seconds per photo and is less accurate than the cloud models; using it as primary with Gemini as fallback works well.

API keys are stored in the iOS Keychain (expo-secure-store) and only ever sent to the provider they belong to.
